			<h2>About the Guppies</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					I chose to add guppies to my tank for a couple of reasons. First of all, they have lots of color to them. This makes them the star of the show in my aquarium.
					 Secondly, they are not agressive fish and can be tankmates with many species. This makes them a great addition to my tank because I wanted more than one type of fish in my tank.
