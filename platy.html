			<h2>About the Platies</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					I wanted to include some bigger fish in my tank, but I was limited in options based on my tank's size. This made the platies a good choice
					because they aren't small like the guppies, and they won't grow too large for my tank. Sometimes, the platies get a little agressive while eating.
					Otherwise, I only see them picking at the mystery snails in my tank. Hopefully they aren't inflicting too much harm on the snails.
